# triangle-or-not
ðŸ¤© My first neural network. It can tell whether an input image is a triangle or not.

## Some information
Written back in September. There are 3 experiments I've done:
1. Using a large number of epochs - gradient descent.
2. Using batches - stochastic gradient descent.
3. Using ReLU as an additional activation function instead of using only tanh and sigmoid.

I was able to start learning about neural networks thanks to [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) spectacular series by [Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ) super helpful tutorial from [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A).
